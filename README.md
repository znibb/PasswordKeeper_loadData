# PasswordKeeper_loadData
Support sketch for PasswordKeeper (https://github.com/znibb/PasswordKeeper), used for storing user credentials in EEPROM of an Atmega32u4 MCU.

The sketch is distributed as a template file that the user creates a copy of that will be ignored by git so that the user credentials never risk getting shared to the public.
